# Museum of Good Code [{❤️}]

The Museum of Good Code (MOGC) is the world's only digital museum dedicated to the collection, preservation, exhibition of good code in all its forms. The mission of the MOBC is to give visibility to uncommonly great code tricks and tips.

This free resource empowers developers to learn from the real-world mistakes of others and improve code quality by not making those same errors themselves.
