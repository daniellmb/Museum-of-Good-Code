The mission of the MOBC is to give visibility to uncommonly great code tricks and tips.\r\n\r\nThis free resource empowers developers to learn from the real-world mistakes of others and improve code quality by not making those same errors themselves.\r\n\r\n#### See the [Museum of Bad Code](https://github.com/daniellmb/Museum-of-Bad-Code) for some anti-patterns to avoid!\r\n\r\n## [Submit Code](../../issues/new) for inclusion in this museum collection.\r\n\r\n### Guidelines\r\n\r\n- [Ensure the code has not been submitted already](../../issues?q=is%3Aissue).\r\n- Use a succinct title and isolated code snippet.\r\n\r\nFollow [@museumofgodcode](https://twitter.com/museumofgodcode) on Twitter for updates as new exhibits added to the growing collection.\r\n",
